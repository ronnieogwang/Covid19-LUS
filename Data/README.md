THe data is organised as follows:
The original data was obtained from this repo https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_ultrasound/tree/master/data 
In that repo, the data was grouped in 3 classes i.e. Covid, Pneumonia and Regular.
We keep the data in the same folder just that the data is classified into multiclasses depending on the artifacts in each image.
Some of the data was not clear to us to classify and this was palced in the ambiguous subfolder.
