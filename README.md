# Covid19-LUS
This project aims at detecting Covid19 using Lung ultra sound and machine learning.
In this project, we have a dataset that identifies Lung Ultra Sound artifacts that can be used to deduce whether a the specimen is positive or negative for Covid19.
We have four artifacts that we are detecting i.e. 
1. A-lines
2. B-lines
3. Consolidation
4. Pleural effusion

The classified data can be found in the data folder
